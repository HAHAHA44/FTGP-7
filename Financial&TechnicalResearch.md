# Financial and Technical Research

### 1.Financial Research
#### 1.1 Industry Competition (https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/gambling) 
This is the Top Gambling DApp ranking, which can be viewed by balance/UAW/volume. Balance is the total value of assets in a DApp's smart contract, UAW is the number of active wallets interacting with the DApp's smart contract, and volume is the total value of smart contracts coming into the DApp. There are three time intervals (24h/7d/30d), and you can also look at the trend plots here. These charts reflect that there are quite a lot of competitors with moderate liquidity and profitability.
#### 1.2 Revenue model 
* House Edge: Gambling/Guessing DApps mainly generate revenue through transaction fees, commissions, and creating a market. Two potential sources of sustainable revenue are as follows:
House Edge: The house edge is the advantage that a DApp has over players in a particular game. For example, in a dice game, a DApp may pay out at lower odds than the actual probability of rolling a specific number, giving the DApp a statistical advantage. This difference between the actual payout and the expenditure is known as the house edge.
* Token Burning: Some gambling and guessing DApps use a token model where players use specific tokens to play. In these cases, the DApp may burn a portion of the tokens used in each betting game, reducing the overall supply of tokens and increasing the value of the remaining tokens.
#### 1.3 User Adoption 
The ongoing interaction between users and a DApp, or user stickiness, is important, and User Active Wallets (UAW) is one metric to measure it. This directly affects the size and liquidity of the pool. Enlarging the pool, adding users, and increasing liquidity are key factors for the success of a DApp. There are several methods we can think of:
* Providing Incentives: To attract new users and increase liquidity, incentives can be provided to encourage more users to participate and interact. For example, a reward program could be offered where the inviter receives a cash or token refund for inviting new users who correctly guess a specific theme activity for the first or first three times.
* Increasing Token Utility: The demand and use of tokens can be increased by increasing their utility. For instance, tokens can be used to pay for service fees, participate in new guessing theme voting, and so on.
* Gathering User Feedback: User feedback is an important aspect, and our DApp can establish a public email to solicit user opinions and suggestions to facilitate user communication and participation. The content can include, but is not limited to, the ease of use, transparency, fairness, and entertainment value of the DApp's theme games.
#### 1.4 Risk Management
Assessing potential risks associated with the DApp, such as operational, financial, and legal risks. Considering risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans, we mainly focus on preventing network attacks, protecting funds storage, financial errors, and regulatory compliance.

### 2.Technical Research
To implement a reliable, efficient, and secure guessing DApp, the following technical aspects need to be considered and optimised.
#### 2.1 Development and Deployment of Smart Contracts 
Smart contracts are the core component of the DApp and require Solidity to write contract code. They implement the logic and rules of the DApp. For a guessing DApp, smart contracts need to implement features such as player betting, result verification, and bonus allocation. The security and reliability of smart contracts are crucial for a guessing DApp, so the contract code needs to be carefully tested and audited for security.
#### 2.2 Security Assurance
Due to the large amount of fund transactions involved in the guessing DApp, appropriate security strategies need to be adopted, such as encrypting and storing user private keys, restricting user operation permissions, etc., to ensure the safety of user assets and contract security. Multi-signature and whitelist control can be used to restrict access or operation of certain resources or functions.
#### 2.3 Optimisation of User Experience 
User experience is one of the key factors for the success of a DApp. It is necessary to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that facilitates users in placing bets, checking results, and withdrawing rewards. At the same time, it is important to provide fast and stable service to enhance user experience.
#### 2.4 Performance Optimisation 
We need to continuously iterate and optimise the functionality and performance of the guessing DApp, improve transaction processing capacity and reduce transaction costs, in order to meet the needs of users and the competitive pressure in the market. Various techniques can be used, such as batch processing, distributed storage, etc., to improve its performance and scalability.
